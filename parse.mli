(** [check_road_input player str json] returns the string [str] if it is
    valid for player [player] to build the road specified in [str],
    which is a string of the form ["\[v1,v2\]"], containing two indices
    that represent a road. [json] represents valid roads.

    Raises [RoadLength] if the input string does not have two indices.
    Raises [Adj_matrix.InvalidRoad (v1,v2)] if at least one index is out
    of range [1,54]. Raises [Adj_matrix.OccupiedRoad (v1,v2)] if the
    road specified is already occupied. *)

(** [check_road_input index] returns corner index [i] if it is valid to
    build a house or city on that corner, i.e. it is in the bounds
    [1,54] and that index is not already occupied.

    Raises [Adj_matrix.OccupiedTileId idx] if corner [i] is already
    occupied. Raises [Adj_matrix.InvalidTileId i] if [i] is not in the
    bounds of [1,54]. *)
