(** [trade_to_bank player player_res bank_res] updates the resources of
    the player according to the resources they wish to trade away in

(** [trade_to_player tr1 tr2 with_bank] returns a new tuple of players

    completed.

    Raises [InvalidTrade] if one or more players has insufficient
    resources for the desired trade.

    Returns an updated list of players. If [building] is [House], then
    they get one of [res]. If it is [City], they get two [res] cards.

    [pl_list] stores the players in decreasing order, i.e. [p3;p2;p1]*)

    id [loc]. *)
val update_pl_settlements : int -> Adj_matrix.building -> int -> unit

(** [update_pl_roads pl_num v1 v2] updates the road matrix in Adj_matrix
    so that there is a road owned by player with number [pl_num] between
