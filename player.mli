(** [trade_to_player tr] returns a new tuple of players whose lists of
    resources have been updated after a trade has been completed. Raises
    [InvalidTrade] if one or more players has insufficient resources for
    the desired trade. Ex. If p1 wants to trade 1 wool and 2 brick for
    p2's 2 lumber: trade_to_player (p1,\[Wool, Brick, Brick\]) (p2,
    \[Lumber, Lumber\]) *)
