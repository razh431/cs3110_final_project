(** The type [tile] represents a hex on the map.

    A tile has a resource [resource_name], a number corresponding to the
    tile for picking up resources when a dice is rolled [tile_dice_num],
    and a fixed position on the board [tile_position]. There are
    adjacent tiles [neighbor_tiles], corners with buildings [corners],
    and it can have the robber [robber]. [corners] is an association
    list where the 6 corners of the hex are mapped to a building.
    [roads] is an association list where the key is the number of the
    player who owns the road and the value is a list of edge tuples. If
    nobody owns the road, then the player number of that road is 9.

    Requires: [tile_position] is from 1-19.

    Ex. Edges of the first tile are (1,5), (5,9), (9,13), (13,8), (8,4),
    (4,1). If player 1 has a road on (1,5), player 2 has a road on
    (5,9), and nobody else has a road on the tile, then [roads] is
    [
      (0, \[(9,13);(8,13);(4,8);(1,4)\]); 
      (1, \[(1,5)\]); 
      (2, \[(5,9)\])
    ] *)
